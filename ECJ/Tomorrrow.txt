        // Energy = idle + utilization*factor
        // power = energy * time window * n        (fixed Time window)
        // Power = integration ( energy/sec )
        // Time window maybe better
        // Event (Container arrival)  + time window (learning model (gaps between event))
        // Time window can be affected by the pattern of works (Problem specific + Data pattern specific) => Learning model

        // => Baseline:
                // Assume all the containers arrived - time 0
                // Fitness calculation need to change

        // Learning model:
                // Distribution for the data Poisson distribution --> generate arrival time for the containers (Simulator?)
                // Learning model to learn --Container arrival time, mem cpu requirements.
                // Weibull Time To Event Recurrent Neural Network
                // LSTM RNN


        // 1. First explore the data
        // 2. Decide a proper model for time windows
        // 3.
