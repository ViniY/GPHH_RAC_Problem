<h1>GPHH RAC Problem</h1>

<p style ="text-align:center">This is a research project for energy efficiency resource allocation in a container-based cloud environment through a Genetic Programming Approach. Comparing to current approaches, the newly proposed approach can consider a large variety information regarding the requirements from containers and also the features of the known resources. In this repo, I will introduce the benchmark dataset we have used and how we processed the dataset, followed with a short description of the problem model and short introduction on our algorithm.</p>
<h2> Dataset Description</h2>
 In this project, we are using two tracing datasets.
